# Load Balancer
We implemented an a priori load balancer before traffic is routed to the Docker Swarm manager nodes. The upstream Nginx configuration will route the request to the manager node with the least number of active connections at that moment (least_conn algorithm). Each of the manager nodes will have an instance of Traefik running to forward requests to ShinyProxy and guarantee a greater fault-tolerance given by the odd number of manager nodes.
